              Hey there! My name is Sara, and I{`'`}m a Boston-based product designer.
            </h3>
            <p className="description-text">
              I{`'`}m currently completing my senior year as a Marketing and Interactive Media student
              at Northeastern University. I found my way to product design through a love of <strong>solving
              problems</strong> and <strong>making people{`'`}s lives a little easier</strong>. With a
              background in both design and front-end development, I enjoy having a hand in all parts of
              the design process â€” from planning to execution.
            </p>
            <p className="description-text">
              In my spare time, you can probably find me cooking/eating vegan food, lifting weights, or
              reading a book.
