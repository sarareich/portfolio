          I spent 7 months as an intern at Forward Financing working on both
          front end development and design. I had the opportunity to see many
          projects through from start to finish, from initial wireframes to writing the final code.
          I designed and implemented a variety of new features that matched the companyâ€™s existing
          UI while improving design consistency across multiple internal- and external-facing web applications.
          I also created design tools such as a Sketch style guide and a live documentation of
          the company{`'`}s shared component library.
